# Abstract

The purpose of our project is to lower the barrier for researchers in Brazil to start using
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and in turn help them joining the world of Open Science. 
We will achieve this by leveraging the existing skills capacity and training 
local Python and R champions as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry (SC&DC) instructors. 
This will allow them share their computational skills with researchers as well as 
propagate the principles essential for making the Open Science paradigm shift.

# Project Description

<!--
By helping researchers in Brazil adopt Open Science approaches, this project will contribute to 
increase international visibility and collaboration of scholars in Brazilian research
organisations. FOSS is an essential component of making Open Science a
prevalent standard. In our approach to bringing the FOSS solutions to researchers in 
Brazil, we will help them make their research more robust, reproducible and 
sustainable.

This project focuses entirely on the research sector in Brazil. A selected
number of research organisations support and are involved in this proposals 
which ensures good local insight and operational background.

## Background

Software Carpentry activities started in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere Silva
who leaded the organisation of some workshops.
The barriers, so far, for more SC&DC workshops per year in Brazil
are the small number of instructors,
the small number of conferences, such as PyData, where contributors could interact,
and the lessons only be available in English---one of the "barrier to entering the computer field" mentioned by Andy Oram at [Open Source in Brazil](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/open-source-in-brazil.csp).
This project aims to reduce the three barriers described before
by financing a SC&DC Instructor Training event,
a SC&DC lesson sprint,
and some SC&DC workshops---including
the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering.

## Instructor Training Event

In order to grow the pull of SC&DC instructors in Brazil
we will run a SC&DC Instructor Training for 20 trainnes.
This 2-day event will take place in Florianópolis, Brazil
where research community has already had some exposure to SC&DC.
This workshop will be offered in English
because SC&DC
don't have any Instructor Training Trainer
who speak Portuguese.
Due the limited number of seats,
we will follow the successful case
of SC&DC's Instructor Training in South Africa in 2016:
we will invite local researchers and members of local coder groups,
such as PyLadies,
to apply for the workshop
and we will select who will be trained.
We will researve a number of seates to members of under-represented groups.

## Lessons Sprint

The Instructor Training will be followed by
a three-days lesson development sprint.
The sprint will provide a opportunity for
the newly trained instructors to familiarise themselves
with SC&DC operations regarding training material development.
It will bring them closer to the community around SC&DC.
The trainees will be able to start working on their checkout tasks.

The sprint will focus on the following two activities:
translating some lessons to Portuguese
([Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder),
[R](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder), and
[OpenRefine](https://github.com/datacarpentry/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson))
and
bootstrap future SC&DC's lessons and capstone examples.

Lesson translation will be lead by Raniere Silva
who is one of the maintainers of SC&DC respective lesson templates
and has [experience translating Software Carpentry Git lesson](http://scf.rgaiacs.com/git/index.html).
We are considering accepting remote participation to this translation effort.

Some ideas for future SC&DC' lessons that will be investigate are
Data Carpentry Lesson for Earth Sciences,
lead by Melissa Mendonça,
and Python capstone featuring [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/),
lead by Alexandre de Siqueira.

## SC&DC Workshops

We received [letters from four Brazilian research groups](https://github.com/rgaiacs/numfocus-2017-grant/tree/master/letters)
interested to host SC&DC workshops
leaded by the experienced instructors visiting Brazil
after they conduct the Instructor Training and lesson sprint.
We should be able to train, in average, 20 researchers per group
and have geography coverage.

In addition,
Aleksandra Pawlik and Haydee Svab will coordinate the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering.
Aleksandra has already organised two WiSE workshops,
one in Poland
and
one in the [United Kingdom](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-26-first-uk-software-carpentry-workshop-women-science-and-engineering).
Haydee has worked with WiSE community around São Paulo
and we will help us to reach out to this workshop target audience.
We are planning to
involve the newly trained instructors in this event.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will
triplicate the number of SC&DC instructors in Brazil,
translate some of the SC&DC's lesson to Portuguese,
train at least 100 Brazilian researchers in FOSS tools
they can use on their work and in turn push Open Science forward.
A long term benefit of this proposal is that Brazilian universities and research centres
will be interested in SC&DC
and become partners making interventions such as this one unnecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects
who can be contributors or maintainers in the future.
