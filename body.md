# Abstract

The use of open source software for research in Brazil is incipient
and we want to change this by training national Python and R champions
as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors
so that they can lower the barrier to other researchers start using
open source software as their go-to option.

# Project Description

By helping researchers in Brazil adopt Open Science aproaches this project will contribute to 
increasing internatonal visbility and collaboration of scholars in Brazilian research
organisations. OSS is an essential component of making Open Science a
prevalent standard. In our approach to bringing the OSS solutions to researchers in 
Brazil we will help them make their research more robust, reproducible and 
sustainable.

This project focuses entirely on the research sector in Brazil. A selected
number of research organisations support and are involved in this proposals 
which ensures good local insight and operational background. 

## Background

Software Carpentry activities started in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere Silva
who organised some workshops with the help of colleagues.
The barriers, so far, for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
increase the number of workshops run in Brazil for a few per year
to a couple of dozen are the small number of instructors,
the small number of conferences, such as PyData, where contributors could interact,
and the lessons not be available in Portuguese.
This project aims to work to reduce the three barriers described before
by providing support to one idea
that Melissa Mendonça, Filipe Fernandes, and other attendees of SciPy Latin America 2016 had,
create a Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanography.

## Instructor Training Event

Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's Instructor Training will be offered
up to 20 new instructors. The event two-days event will be hosted in Florianópolis, Brazil
so that Melissa Mendonça, Juliana Leonel and their collaborators could be trained.
We will invited members of the local PyLadies group to be trained.
Since Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry don't have any Instructor Trainer Trainer
who speak Portuguese, this workshop will be offered in English.
And because of the limited number of seats we will select participants after an open round of applications based on the successful case of Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's Instructor Training in South Africa in 2016.

## Lessons Sprint

Following the Instructor Training event,
a three-days lesson sprint will take place also in Florianópolis.
The sprint will provide a opportunity for Instructor Training attendees
work on their final assignment
and get more knowledge of how Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry operate.

During the sprint we will have contributors organising activities on lesson translation to Portuguese
and Data Carpentry lesson creation.
At the end of the third day,
we expected to have (1) four lessons translated (Shell, OpenRefine, Python, and R),
(2) Data Carpentry lesson for Oceanography, and
(3) Software Carpentry lesson with scikit-image examples.

Lesson translation will be lead by Raniere Silva
who is one of the maintainers of Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lesson template
and has previous experience translating Software Carpentry's Git lesson.

Oceanography lesson will be lead by Melissa Mendonça
who organised a workshop in 2016.
This lesson will be first developed in Portuguese
since we aim to use it right after the sprint.
In the future,
Data Carpentry should be able to work to clean
the English translation provided by a automatic translation tool.

Scikit-images examples will be lead by Alexandre de Siqueira
who is one of the maintainers of scikit-image
and wrote a book about GNU Octave in 2015.

## First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering

Aleksandra Pawlik will organise the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering
based on her experience organising a similar event on the UK.
Instructors for this workshop are not defined yet
but we will invite new instructors who attended the Instructor Training event
to teach one module or be helpers.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshops

The Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanography will be tested
by Melissa Mendonça and Juliana Leonel in Florianópolis
in the weeks following the lesson translation sprint.

We also received letters of interest from the Federal University of Ceará
to host a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop
given that some experienced instructors will be visiting Brazil.
This additional workshops will have in average 20 learners.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will
increase the number of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors in Brazil,
translate some of the Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lesson to Portuguese,
train at least 40 Brazilian researchers in free and open source tools
they can use on their work.
A long term benefit of this proposal is that Brazilian universities and research centres
will be interested in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
and become partners making interventions such as this one unnecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects.
