# Abstract

The purpose of our project is to lower the barrier for researchers in Brazil to start using
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and in turn make it their default choice helping them join the world of Open Science. 
We will achieve this by leveraging the existing skills capacity and training 
local Python and R champions as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors. 
We will also work with them to help them become advocates for Open Science. This
will allow them share their computational skills with researchers as well as 
propagate the principles essential for making this paradigm shift.

# Project Description

By helping researchers in Brazil adopt Open Science approaches, this project will contribute to 
increase international visibility and collaboration of scholars in Brazilian research
organisations. FOSS is an essential component of making Open Science a
prevalent standard. In our approach to bringing the FOSS solutions to researchers in 
Brazil, we will help them make their research more robust, reproducible and 
sustainable.

This project focuses entirely on the research sector in Brazil. A selected
number of research organisations support and are involved in this proposals 
which ensures good local insight and operational background. 

## Background

Software Carpentry activities started in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere Silva
who leaded the organisation of some workshops.
The barriers, so far, for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
increase the number of workshops in Brazil from a few per year
to a couple of dozen are the small number of instructors,
the small number of conferences, such as PyData, where contributors could interact,
and the lessons only be available in English,
one of the "barrier to entering the computer field" mentioned by Andy Oram.
This project aims to work to reduce the three barriers described before
by financing a Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Instructor Training event,
a Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry lesson sprint,
the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering,
and satelite Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops.

## Instructor Training Event

Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's Instructor Training will be offered
up to 20 new instructors. It will be a two-days event hosted in Florianópolis, Brazil where three of the proposer are located.
This workshop will be offered in English
because Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
don't have any Instructor Trainer Trainer
who speak Portuguese.
Due the limited number of seats,
we will follow the successful case
of Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's Instructor Training in South Africa in 2016:
we will invite local researchers and members of local coder groups,
such as PyLadies,
to apply for the workshop
and we will select who will be trained.

## Lessons Sprint

Following the Instructor Training event,
a three-days lesson sprint will take place also in Florianópolis.
The sprint will provide a opportunity for Instructor Training attendees
work on their final assignment, a pull request to one lesson,
and get more knowledge of how Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry operate.

During the sprint we will have contributors organising activities on lesson translation to Portuguese.
At the end of the third day,
we expected to have (1) three lessons translated
([Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder),
[R](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder), and
[OpenRefine](https://github.com/datacarpentry/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson)).
Lesson translation will be lead by Raniere Silva
who is one of the maintainers of Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lesson template
and has previous experience translating Software Carpentry's Git lesson.
We are considering accepting remote participation to this translation effort.

The sprint will also serve as a opportunity
to some of the proposers to start working on their own ideas
for future Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lessons
and captstone examples,
specially Melissa Mendonça who is interested in Data Carpentry Lesson for Earth Sciences
and Alexandre de Siqueira who is interested in a capstone featuring [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/).

## First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering

Aleksandra Pawlik and Haydee Svab will coordinate the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering
based on Aleksandra's experience organising a similar event on the United Kingdom
and Haydee's connection with women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in São Paulo, Brazil.
Instructors for this workshop are not defined yet
but we will invite new instructors who attended the Instructor Training event
to teach one module or be helpers.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshops

We also received letters of interest from the Federal University of Ceará
to host a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop
given that some experienced instructors will be visiting Brazil.
This additional workshops will have in average 20 learners.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will
increase the number of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors in Brazil,
translate some of the Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lesson to Portuguese,
train at least <!-- FIXME --> 40 Brazilian researchers in free and open source tools
they can use on their work.
A long term benefit of this proposal is that Brazilian universities and research centres
will be interested in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
and become partners making interventions such as this one unnecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects.
