# Abstract

The use of open source software for research in Brazil is incipient
and we want to change this by training national Python and R champions
as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors
so that they can lower the barrier to other researchers start using
open source software as their go-to option.

# Project Description

Software Carpentry activities started in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere Silva
who organised some workshops with the help of colleagues.
The barriers, so far, for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
increase the number of workshops run in Brazil for a few per year
to a couple of dozen are the small number of instructors,
the small number of conferences, such as PyData, where contributors could interact,
and the lessons not be available in Portuguese.
This project aims to work to reduce the three barriers described before
by providing support to one idea
that Melissa Mendonça, Filipe Fernandes, and other attendees of SciPy Latin America 2016 had,
create a Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanography.

## Instructor Training Event

In order to grow the pull of Software and Data Carpentry instructors in Brazil
we will run Software and Data Carpentry Instructor Training for 20 trainees. 
This 2-day event event will take place in Florianópolis, Brazil where the 
research community has already had some exposure to the Carpentry workshops.
Namely Melissa Mendonça, Juliana Leonel and their collaborators will be able to attend
the Instructor Training.

We will reserve a number of seats at the training for the local PyLadies group. Diversity 
and making training in computational skills is accesible to everyone is one of the 
Software and Data Carpentry values which we alre also of great importance to us.

We expect that the workshop will receive a lot of interest and there will be more potential
participants than the number of seats we can offer. We will first collect applications which 
will allow us allocate the seats to those candidates who will bring most benefit contributing to
eResearch in Brazil. We will make the selection process fully transparent and appoint an independent
committee to select the trainees.
 
Since none of the current Instructor Trainers for Software and Data Carpentry can speak
Portuguese, this workshop will be offered in English.


## Lessons Sprint

The Instructor Training will be followed by 
a three-days lesson development sprint. The sprint will provide a opportunity for 
the newly trained instructors to familiarise themselves with Software and Data
Carpentry operations regarding training material development. It will
bring them closer to the community around Carpentries. The trainees will be able to 
start working on their checkout tasks.

The sprint will focus on the following three activities:
(1) translating the lessons to Portuguese  (Shell, OpenRefine, Python, and R),
(2) developing Data Carpentry lesson for Oceanography, and
(3) developing Software Carpentry lesson with scikit-image examples.

Lesson translation will be lead by Raniere Silva
who is one of the maintainers of Software and Data Carpentry respective lesson templates
and has experience translating Software Carpentry Git lesson.

Oceanography lesson will be lead by Melissa Mendonça
who organised a Data Carpentry workshop in Brazil in 2016.
This lesson will be first developed in Portuguese
since we aim to use it right after the sprint.
In the future, we aim to support translating this lesson into 
English.

Scikit-images examples will be lead by Alexandre de Siqueira
who is one of the maintainers of scikit-image
and wrote a book about GNU Octave in 2015.

## First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering

Aleksandra Pawlik will organise the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering.
Aleksandra has already organised two WiSE workshops, one in Poland and one in the U.K. 
We are planning to involve the newly trained instructors in this event.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshops

The Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanography will be tested
by Melissa Mendonça and Juliana Leonel in Florianópolis
in the weeks following the lesson translation sprint.

We also received letters of interest from the Federal University of Ceará
to host a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop
given that some experienced instructors will be visiting Brazil.
This additional workshops will have in average 20 learners.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will
increase the number of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors in Brazil,
translate some of the Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lesson to Portuguese,
train at least 40 Brazilian researchers in free and open source tools
they can use on their work.
A long term benefit of this proposal is that Brazilian universities and research centres
will be interested in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
and become partners making interventions such as this one unnecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects.
