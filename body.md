# Abstract

The purpose of our project is to lower the barrier for researchers in Brazil to start using
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and in turn help them joining the world of Open Science. 
We will achieve this by leveraging the existing skills capacity and training 
local Python and R champions as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry (SC&DC) instructors. 
This will allow them share their computational skills with researchers as well as 
propagate the principles essential for making the Open Science paradigm shift.

# Project Description

<!--
By helping researchers in Brazil adopt Open Science approaches, this project will contribute to 
increase international visibility and collaboration of scholars in Brazilian research
organisations. FOSS is an essential component of making Open Science a
prevalent standard. In our approach to bringing the FOSS solutions to researchers in 
Brazil, we will help them make their research more robust, reproducible and 
sustainable.

This project focuses entirely on the research sector in Brazil. A selected
number of research organisations support and are involved in this proposals 
which ensures good local insight and operational background.

## Background

Software Carpentry activities started in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere Silva
who leaded the organisation of some workshops.
The barriers, so far, for more SC&DC workshops per year in Brazil
are the small number of instructors,
the small number of conferences, such as PyData, where contributors could interact,
and the lessons only be available in English---one of the "barrier to entering the computer field" mentioned by Andy Oram at [Open Source in Brazil](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/open-source-in-brazil.csp).
This project aims to reduce the three barriers described before
by financing a SC&DC Instructor Training event,
a SC&DC lesson sprint,
and some SC&DC workshops---including
the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering.

## Instructor Training Event

SC&DC's Instructor Training will be offered
up to 20 new instructors. It will be a two-days event hosted in Florianópolis, Brazil where three of the proposers are located.
This workshop will be offered in English
because SC&DC
don't have any Instructor Training Trainer
who speak Portuguese.
Due the limited number of seats,
we will follow the successful case
of SC&DC's Instructor Training in South Africa in 2016:
we will invite local researchers and members of local coder groups,
such as PyLadies,
to apply for the workshop
and we will select who will be trained.
We are committed to help under-represented groups in our selection.

## Lessons Sprint

Following the Instructor Training event,
a three-days lesson sprint will take place also in Florianópolis.
The sprint will provide a opportunity for Instructor Training attendees
work on their final assignment, a pull request to one lesson,
and get more knowledge of how SC&DC operate.

During the sprint we will have contributors organising activities on lesson translation to Portuguese.
At the end of the third day,
we expected to have three lessons translated
([Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder),
[R](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder), and
[OpenRefine](https://github.com/datacarpentry/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson)).
Lesson translation will be lead by Raniere Silva
who is one of the maintainers of SC&DC's lesson template
and has [previous experience translating Software Carpentry's Git lesson](http://scf.rgaiacs.com/git/index.html).
We are considering accepting remote participation to this translation effort.

The sprint will also serve as a opportunity
to some of the proposers to start working on their own ideas
for future SC&DC's lessons
and captstone examples,
specially Melissa Mendonça who is interested in Data Carpentry Lesson for Earth Sciences
and Alexandre de Siqueira who is interested in a Python capstone featuring [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/).

## SC&DC Workshops

We received [letters from four Brazilian research groups](https://github.com/rgaiacs/numfocus-2017-grant/tree/master/letters)
interested to host SC&DC workshops
leaded by the experienced instructors visiting Brazil
after they conduct the Instructor Training and lesson sprint.
We should be able to train, in average, 20 researchers per group
and have geograph coverage.

In addition,
Aleksandra Pawlik and Haydee Svab will coordinate the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering
based on [Aleksandra's experience organising a similar event on the United Kingdom](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-26-first-uk-software-carpentry-workshop-women-science-and-engineering)
and Haydee's connection with women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in São Paulo, Brazil.
Instructors for this workshop are not defined yet
but we will invite new instructors who attended the Instructor Training event
to teach one module or be helpers.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will
triplicate the number of SC&DC instructors in Brazil,
translate some of the SC&DC's lesson to Portuguese,
train at least 100 Brazilian researchers in FOSS tools
they can use on their work and in turn push Open Science forward.
A long term benefit of this proposal is that Brazilian universities and research centres
will be interested in SC&DC
and become partners making interventions such as this one unnecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects
who can be contributors or maintainers in the future.
