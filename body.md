# Abstract

FOSS is an essential component of making Open Science a prevalent
standard. The purpose of this project is to help Brazilian researchers
on their adoption of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which will
help them entering the world of Open Science.

We will achieve this aim by training Brazilian Python and R specialists as
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry (SC&DC) instructors, thus leveraging
local skills.

This will allow them to share their computational skills with other
researchers without depending on commercial tools, as well as to propagate
the essential principles for embracing the Open Science paradigm shift.

# Project Description

By helping Brazil to adopt Open Science approaches, this project will
contribute to increase international visibility and collaboration of
scholars in Brazilian organisations.

In our approach to bringing FOSS solutions to Brazilian researchers, we
will help them make their research more robust, reproducible and
sustainable.

This project focuses entirely on the research sector. Selected Brazilian
organisations support and are involved in this proposal, which ensures
good local insight and operational background.

## Background

Software Carpentry activities were introduced in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere
Silva, who leaded the organisation of some workshops. The barriers for
more SC&DC workshops in Brazil so far are the small number of instructors
and conferences (such as PyData or SciPy, where contributors can interact
and present their research), and the lessons, only available in
English -- one of the "barriers to enter the computer field" mentioned
by Andy Oram at
[Open Source in Brazil](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/open-source-in-brazil.csp).
This project aims to reduce the barriers described before by financing a
SC&DC Instructor Training event, a SC&DC lesson sprint, and some SC&DC
workshops -- including the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data
Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering.

## Instructor Training Event

SC&DC's Instructor Training will be offered to up to 20 new instructors
as a two-days event hosted in Florianópolis, Brazil, where three of the
proposers are located. This workshop will be offered in English because
SC&DC do not have any Instructor Training Trainer who speak Portuguese.

Due to the limited number of seats, we will follow the successful case
of SC&DC's Instructor Training in South Africa in 2016, selecting who
will be trained among researchers and members of local coding groups,
such as PyLadies. We are committed to help underrepresented groups in
our selection.

## Lessons Sprint

Following the Instructor Training event, a three-days lesson sprint will
take place also in Florianópolis. The sprint will provide an opportunity
for Instructor Training attendees work on their final assignment, a pull
request to one lesson, and get more knowledge of how SC&DC operate.

During the sprint we will have contributors translating lessons to
Portuguese. At the end of the third day, we expected to have three lessons
translated
([Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder),
[R](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder), and
[OpenRefine](https://github.com/datacarpentry/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson)).

Lesson translation will be lead by Raniere Silva, who is one of the maintainers
of SC&DC's lesson template and has
[previous experience translating Software Carpentry's Git lesson](http://scf.rgaiacs.com/git/index.html).
We are considering accepting remote participation to this translation effort.

The sprint will also serve as a opportunity to some of the proposers to
start working on their own ideas for future SC&DC's lessons and capstone
examples, such as Melissa Mendonça, interested in Data Carpentry Lesson
for Earth Sciences, and Alexandre de Siqueira, interested in a Python
capstone featuring [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/).

## SC&DC Workshops

We received
[letters from four Brazilian research groups](https://github.com/rgaiacs/numfocus-2017-grant/tree/master/letters)
interested to host SC&DC workshops leaded by the experienced instructors
visiting Brazil after they conduct the Instructor Training and lesson
sprint. We should be able to train, in average, 20 researchers per group
and have geography coverage.

In addition, Aleksandra Pawlik and Haydee Svab will coordinate the First
Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science
and Engineering based on
[Aleksandra's experience organising a similar event on the United Kingdom](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-26-first-uk-software-carpentry-workshop-women-science-and-engineering)
and Haydee's connection with women in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics in São Paulo, Brazil. Instructors for this workshop are
not defined yet but we will invite the instructors who attended the
Instructor Training event to teach one module, or be helpers.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will triplicate the number of SC&DC instructors in
Brazil, translate some of the SC&DC's lesson to Portuguese, train at least
100 Brazilian researchers in FOSS tools they can use on their work and
in turn push Open Science forward. As a long term benefit of this proposal,
Brazilian universities and research centres will be interested in SC&DC
and become partners, making interventions such as this one unnecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of
other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects who can be contributors
or maintainers in the future.
